The K5UTD Amateur Radio Club is not currently holding regular meetings, however we invite you to join K5UTD members at the Richardson Wireless Klub general meetings. Be sure to wear a shirt or something that identifies you as being part of UTD! 

RWK meetings are held on the 2nd Monday of the month at 6:30PM. The meeting location is St. Barnabas church in Richardson (Mimosa and Belt Line).

More info about the RWK meetings can be found at [k5rwk.org](http://www.k5rwk.org/).
