Join us for the first meet and greet of the semester on Tuesday, October 18th at 7:00 PM in ECS North 3.116.

This is a great meeting to go to if you have been coming to our meetings for years or have only just heard of us. We will be discussing the club focus for this school year and would appreaciate the input from all who can make it. Door prizes will be awarded for those who make it out.

We will also be operating our station for the ARRL School Club Roundup contest. This is a great chance to get on the radio and have some fun in our award winning radio room.

More details for School CLub Roundup can be found at: [http://www.arrl.org/school-club-roundup](http://www.arrl.org/school-club-roundup).
