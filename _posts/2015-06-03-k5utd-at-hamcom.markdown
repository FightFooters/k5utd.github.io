The K5UTD ARC will be present at HamCom next week, and we'd like your help getting ready for the event. We will be setting up a table and selling equipment that has been donated to the club. The event is being setup on Thursday (6/9), and will be open to the public on Friday and Saturday (6/10-6/11).

The current plan is to move the equipment on Thursday afternoon, and sell it all on Friday/Saturday.

See this link for more details about the event and venue location:
